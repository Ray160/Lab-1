## Summer Project
Over the summer this year, I worked on making a game in unity. I decided to make a bullet hell style game since I thought it looked fun.
Here is a [Video demo](unitygame.mp4) of a powerup in the game. It was interesting to write in `C#` for the first time.  
  
The features I have thought up of for this project and their completion status are:

- [x] Character movement
- [x] 2 firing modes
- [x] Dodging
- [x] Spiral type enemies
- [x] Jousting looking powerup
- [ ] Lasers
- [ ] Grid attacks
- [ ] Pre-hitscan indicators
- [ ] Tracking enemies
- [ ] Missiles
- [ ] Rings
